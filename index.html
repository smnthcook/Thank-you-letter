           <p>
               Dear Mom,
               I wanted to thank you for always supporting me
               in everything I do. I really wanted to make this
               out to you as you're someone who has always
               cheered me on even if I wasn't that good at it. 
               I'm getting better and I will keep getting better
               just for you! This is just one way to showcase my learning
               and to show you all your support isn't for nothing!
               Thank you, Mama, for being the best Mom ever!
           </p>
